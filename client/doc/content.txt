What is an NFT?
An NFT is a digital asset that is very unique – that is, non-fungible. An NFT can represent a number of digital properties, including artwork, collectibles, video snippets, an item
from a video game or even a music album, among others. the main thing is that - “It can’t be traded with another one, like a dollar can be traded for another dollar,” says Dr. Richard Smith, CEO of The Foundation for the Study of Cycles, explaining non-fungibility.

NFTs are built on the same kind of infrastructure – blockchain – that cryptocurrencies are. Because they use blockchain, the transfer of an interest in NFTs is recorded on the blockchain, putting ownership on a permanent record, making it impossible (or at least very hard) to falsify.

But why are NFTs in such high demand? The majority of the NFTs you purchase is nothing but a digital certificate that you can't touch, wear or use in your everyday life.
